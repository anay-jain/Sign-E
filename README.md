## Description:
A sensor powered glove to convert sign language into audio format. The glove will be connected to any mobile device through which the gesture converted audio will be audible. Our idea is powered by Machine Learning algorithms that automatically converts the language to audio signals. This is a gadget that gives voice to the mute people.

Almost every human nowadays owns a mobile phone. Hence we can trasmit our glove's data to their phones to convert the data into human understandable signals.

## Problem 1:
360 million people are deaf, 240 million people are mute and among all these people only a 70 million people know sign language. Even if these 70 million people know sign language they can't convey their message properly as most of the normal people can not understand sign language. So to overcome this barrier of communication our gadget is highly scalable.

## Problem 2 : 
In any normal spoken language a person who listens generally has a different interpretation from what the speaker has intended to speak. This drawback is extremely vast and noticeable in sign language conversations. The power of Machine Learning algorithm will gradually increase the accuracy and reliability of the communication process.
